# FireClient
## About
FireClient is a work in progress Minecraft 1.20.1 client (with later versions coming) that is for general use, but specialized for SMP players.
* Designed to keep a vanilla-ish look
* Built upon a custom modules system, which allows for incredibly fast development
* Very leightweight (but also has no FPS gains)
* Custom UI system that allows for the positioning and scaling of all modules
* epic :D

## Modules
* AngleDisplay - Shows your current yaw (angle) in the bottom left corner of the screen. Helps with bow boosting **[WHITELISTED]**
* ArmorHUD - Displays the remaining durability of all equipped armor
* AutoMessage - Allows caching of /msg and similar commands, which removes the repetitive /msg or /r chatters face on servers
* BowSwap - Allows for the swapping of bows and arrows with keybinds **[CHEAT] [WHITELISTED]**
* Coordinates - Simple coordinates display, with an optional window mode that allows you to open a new window that displays your coordinates!
* CoordsChat - Allows you to send your current location in chat, or to specified players with the press of a button **[WHITELISTED]**
* DiscordRPC - Simple Discord Rich Presence implementation **[UNFINISHED]**
* FullBright - Sets the in-game brightness to 100000, making everything fully lit
* Nametag - Allows you to toggle your own nametag, change what your nametag says **[BROKEN]**, and toggle the rendering of all nametags
* RenderWorld - Allows you to toggle the rendering of the blocks with the press of a button **[CHEAT]**
* ScrollClick - Allows you to use each scroll of the mouse as a click **[CHEAT] [WHITELISTED]**
* ToggleablePieChart - Implementation of my other mod with the same name. Allows the moving and scaling of the Debug PieChart, and the toggling of it
* (More to come!!)

## Planned Features
* More modules
* More settings
* Better/Refined GUI
* Public release
* **[Unlikely]** Custom Launcher

## Known Bugs
* ToggleablePieChart is just broken
* HideShieldsInRiptide is broken with FeatherClient (Shields still display)
* Module placement edge cases causing the module to be misaligned, or to go out of bounds entirely

## Notes
* Some modules are marked as **[WHITELISTED]** which means only certain players can access them. This is because the original module was developed as a commission, and I wouldn't feel comfortable allowing everybody access to a paid module. Will become available one day...
* Some modules are marked as **[CHEAT]** and should be avoided. They only remain becuase I use them, but not in a disallowed way (ex: using RenderWorld to find pillagers during a raid). The module will most likely get you banned on servers and SMPs, so be warned!
* Some modules are marked as **[UNFINISHED]** which means I am being lazy :D
* The name is derived from a player's username from an old SMP. You know who you are :3
* I am a solo developer, please don't expect too much
